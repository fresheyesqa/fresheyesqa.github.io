                  <h3>QA Projects</h3>
                  <p>Projects start at $500 per app or website. Cost is affected by a number of factors, including the number of pages or views that need to be tested, the complexity of flows or number of user types, access to a local copy of the code and turnaround time needed. Rush options are available, and the cost will depend on the schedule of currently-booked clients.</li>

                  <h3>Process</h3>
                  <p>Our first call will cover the scope of what you'd like tested, and you'll receive an estimate of the cost, a proposal of work, and payment schedule. 25% of payment is due upon signing, 25% more will be due at the midpoint check-in, and the final 50% will be due upon reciept of work.</p>
                  <p>If you'd prefer to work on an ongoing basis, we'll start with a small project, 5-20 hours, to make sure we're on the same page. After that, we'll discuss weekly availability, and invoices will be sent monthly.</p>
