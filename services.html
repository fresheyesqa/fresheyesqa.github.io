                  <h3>Pre-Launch Feature and UX Review</h3>
                  <p>Launching something new? Get your new code reviewed for bugs, user experience and usability before showing it to your customers. Includes a full written report of bugs, issues and recommendations, and adding them directly to your bug tracker if desired.</p>

                  <h3>QA Sweep</h3>
                  <p>Independent black box hunt for bugs, accessibility and basic security issues across your site or application. Includes cross-browser and platform checks, as well as UI and usability recommendations. Similar to Pre-Launch Feature and UX Review, but covers your entire site or app, and if done on a recurring basis, can also catch regression issues. </p>

                  <h3>Full Accessibility Audit</h3>
                  <p>Accessibility is becoming more important as the internet becomes more necessary in everyone's lives. A / AA / AAA level audit, review of your full website or app using screenreader and other accessibility tools.

                  <h3>Basic User Interface Automated Test Suite</h3>
                  <p>Tests are a crucial part of development, but they can be a pain to write and cause cycle lag if they are too bloated. Have us build you a set of critical-only user interface flows that are easy to update, and can be run across browsers using the automated suite of your choice. Tests can be kicked off manually by developers, or added to your CI flow.</p>

                  <h3>Copy Proofreading</h3>
                  <p>Discrete vs discreet can happen to anyone. But let that be someone else! Whether it's emails, website content, a new landing page, captions or transcripts, an extra review is always worth it. And hey, we didn't take all those AP classes for nothing! Grammar, spelling, word choice, structure, semantic analysis, as well as accessible readability are all reviewed, with issues noted individually and in an aggregate report.</p>

                  <h3>Technical Proofreading</h3>
                  <p>If your product includes documentation, guides, whitepapers and other longform documents of a technical nature, ensuring readability and structural flow can be the distinction that sets your product apart from others. Having a customer-oriented philosophy means caring that all your content, from marketing to API docs, is as clear and understandable as it can be. Includes grammatical etc. factors listed in Copy Proofreading, as well as testing the content itself for accuracy.</p>

                  <p>In our first call, we will cover the scope of what you'd like tested, your timeframe, and your budget. Within 2 business days, you'll receive a proposal of work, schedule of milestones and checkins, and payment schedule. 25% of payment is due upon signing, 25% more will be due at the midpoint check-in, and the final 50% will be due upon reciept of work.</p>
                    <h3>Test Project</h3>
                  <p>To make sure we're on the same page, we're happy to scope out a small project (usually 5-20 hours), before launching into larger or ongoing work.</p>

                  <h2>Hourly Rates</h2> 
                  <p>Fresh Eyes QA is available on an hourly basis, and rates will depend on the scope and nature of work and other client obligations. Contract will include weekly availability, responsibilites and check-in schedule. Invoices will be sent monthly.</p>
                  <div class="container"> 
                    <ul>
                      <li>Manual Testing starts at $60 / hour, and includes cross-browser testing, A-level accessibility recommendations, testing on real iOS and Android devices (depending on availability), and UI / UX recommendations if you want them.</li>
                      <li>Automated Testing starts at $75 / hour, and depends highly on if you already have automation, or are developing it from scratch. This may include not only the UI tests, but also linters, development and extension of your code style guide, and recommendations on your CI/CD workflow.</li>
                      <li>Proofreading starts at $30 / hour, but it makes more sense to do it on a project basis since the scope can vary so wildly. Technical proofreading will be more expensive than copy-only.</li>
